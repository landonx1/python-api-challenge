# python-api-challenge

This is an api key repo that visualizes weather of hundreds of cities across the world and shows the connection between weather variables and latitude using plots and explanations

This api repo also seeks out coordinates for many cities and visualizes them too.

Outside help: I used Stack Overflow to help with writing my code.
